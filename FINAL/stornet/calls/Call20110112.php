<h1>Jan. 11, 2011</h1>
<p>Attendees: Ajae, Dimitrios, Dantong, Junmin, Alex</p>
<ul>
<li>OSG All Hands Meeting in March to present StorNet</li>
<ul>
<li>Alex will attend and present StorNet, and Shawn will take care of DYNES.</li>
</ul>
<li>Alex will forward a paper on the recent cloud based climate analysis.</li>
<li>CHEP2010 paper submission - completed</li>
<li>Refine our task list until the end of this fiscal year. We'll test and validate StorNet at another DOE lab. There are some challenges to deploy the TeraPaths software to integrate with the production routers. We will utilize the ANI tabletop testbed as an alternative one. The local null mode in TeraPaths seems to be appropriate for the restricted sites, and layer 3 MPLS tunnel can be independently configured by ESnet.</li>
<li>Alex will check how LBNL sets up the dynamic circuits with other labs, and whether we can use the similar approach.</li>
<li>We'll pursue an extension for StorNet.</li>
</ul>
